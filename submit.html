When we pitched this theme to the public, we did so with the knowledge that space is a nebulous concept. Space is as interdisciplinary as it gets–an intersection of philosophy, mathematics, psychology, geography. It can take many forms, and mean many things. <br><br>

Cosmic space, psychological space, locational space. Space as philosophy, as poetry, as activism, as an assertion of power. We invite you to tell us what space means to you in a claustrophobic world that feels more and more hostile with each passing day, all sharp edges and teeth. We watch as the environment rapidly deteriorates and natural spaces vanish. We are pushed out of political spaces that are theoretically meant to serve us. Trans people are gatekept from gender affirming healthcare, disabled people are forced to navigate a world that was not made for them, and we live in a world that remains staunchly hostile to racial minorities–it seems that there will never be peace for the most vulnerable among us. There are very few pockets of space in which we can seek empathy and understanding from one another. Even fewer in the context of global collapse. Perhaps this has always been the case, an inevitability, but we’d like to imagine a future where that isn’t true. <br><br>

The fatigue of negotiating space, of calculating every physical interaction, of constant catastrophe demanding our mental space, is not something we are equipped to endure. We shouldn't have to. But in a world that demands we persevere, all we can do is our best.<br><br>

For Issue 06, Cicada Creative Magazine calls on undergraduates to meditate on what space means to you. However it manifests itself–inner, outer, psychological, physical–we would like to document what this looks like in 2022. In a world that is constantly rattling with tension, we’d like to carve out a space for you to express your thoughts and feelings. And given that this theme won, we are inclined to believe this is something you want, too. So, we will provide. <br><br>

Here are a few ideas of what you can engage with. It’s a starting point, not a prompt; feel free to meditate on space in any way you wish.<br><br>

<ul>
	<li> Place attachment is described as the relationship between identity and specific locations. The emotional bond that exists between you and space. A childhood home, an old haunt, a landscape that moves you, a cultural landmark that grounds you in your identity–an intersection of memory and “now.” What is your space? </li>
	<li>How much control over our space do we truly have? If isolation and crowdedness are equally involuntary, what does that mean for our autonomy? How can we define the boundaries of our space? How can we assert those boundaries?</li>
	<li>Feel free to take this all the way to outer space. In the field of physical cosmology, many theorists have tried to grasp the observable universe. Where did space come from? How did our universe come to be? </li>
	<li>Demanding space can be revolutionary. For minorities that are expected to shrink, refusing to do so is an inherently subversive action. What does that look like for you? What has it looked like for activists of the past? In the context of social science, this concept has been folded into several fields, disciplines, and theories, including, but not limited to: feminism, postcolonialism, Black empowerment, Marxism, and urban theory. What does this make you think, feel, and consider? </li>
	<li>Many fears and phobias are centered around the concept of space. Are there elements of space that frighten you? The open sea, crowds, outer space, any place outside your home? </li>
</ul>
<br>
